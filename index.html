        <h1>Time and Ram usage for joining on strings in Python</h1>

        <h3>Background</h3>

        Over on StackOverflow somebody proposed an answer which included this:
        <code>" ".join(list(some_str))</code>.

        <p>
          I believe (based on divination, crystal balls, and blind prejudice) that
          this usage of list is based on the erroneous assumption that it can somehow
          "make" iterables from non-iterable objects, and that one should only use list
          when one <em>wants a list</em>, i.e. to a permanent editable datastructure.
          Thus I would always use <code>" ".join(some_str)</code>.
        </p>

        <p>
          But someone in the comments pointed out what I'd never thought of: that a list
          was used internally, and that it might actually <em>save</em> ram and/or be a
          speedup to make the list ourselves.
        </p>

        <p>
          This is obviously a micro-optimisation, and therefore <em>bad</em>.  If you
          allow such profane thoughts into your head when coding, the gremlins will take
          revenge and your code will grind to a halt as unknown side-effects of your
          micro-optimisations, innocuous in themselves, combine to form a horrible
          grinding mess, slower and more cantankerous even than the lastest operating
          system from that company.  The Oracle has spoken.  (Actually, not Oracle, they
          had something to do with that language, didn't they, the one that doubtless
          inspired the programmer whose work caused an error I recently hit:
          <code> Incompatible Operands: float and FloatObject</code>...
          Well, somebody authoritative has spoken, anyhow.)
        </p>

        <p>
          On the other hand, it would be fun to test it and see what difference it does
          make, woudn't it?
        </p>

        <p>
          Here are some graphs of execution for multiple different python versions, made
          with the excellent <a href="https://github.com/Hasenpfote/perfbench">perfbench</a>.
          The data is made in github actions, and the results are then hosted
          here.  This html file is hand-coded because I couldn't be bothered to
          use a templating language.  For the fun of it we also test two further
          methods: <code>" ".join([*s])</code> and <code>s.replace("", " ")[1:-1]</code>.
          The latter is obvious when you see it, but it would never have
          occurred to me.
